# Lead Forensics
### Pulling information out of Lead Forensics.

**Main line of work:**
  > Get the most relevant APIs
  
  > Check who has been in `our` web 
      -> If we have a web, obtain the information of who has been inside.

  > How much time has this 'company' or 'person' stayed in our page
  
  > What exactly has he clicked.
  
  > In what instances are the Client ID and the KEY used.
  
  > GET `NAME`, `POSITION` (__meaning the location__), `IP`,  `WEB` (__from which web do they come from if there is any case of that__), `DATE`, `TIME`, `etc`.

**Issues to deal with:**

  1. Create a code out of these APIs
    - Try and check them on `Javascript`
     - *probably* has to **work**
    - Need to **pull** the information in a *clear and easy* way to understand it.

  2. Choose the correct APIs
   - There are more than 20 APIs, choose the ones that are the most **relevant** for this project.
 
  3. Get the *DATA* using *JS* or *Java* 
   - 110% ask for help

  4. Try to implement the `source code` to **get/pull** the data.
    - First try to see if it works with the code given, if not, just ask (i guess).

  5. Do a `VIDEO` or `Document` explaining how everything is working.

*If possible read the Guide if there is anything good enough in there.*
